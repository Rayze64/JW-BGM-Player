# JW BGM Player
# JW BGM Player

A simple, smart background music (BGM) player designed for Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses Kingdom Hall meetings.

üéµ **Plays music from a folder** you select.

‚è± **Automatically stops exactly at specified end times** (e.g., 09:55 and 10:55), without cutting songs mid-play.

üîÅ **Picks random songs without repeating**, fitting perfectly into the time left before the meeting starts.

üïπÔ∏è Includes an **override field** for custom end times, and a **post-meeting button** to play music indefinitely.

ü™ü Runs as a lightweight Windows app with a simple GUI (built in Python with `tkinter` and `pygame`).
